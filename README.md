# DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS
_Spreadsheets:_
- Spreadsheets are a widely used tool in analytics, providing an intuitive way to organize data into rows and columns.
- They are productivity software packages that allow users to create documents that organize any type of data into rows and columns.
- Users can place any data they like in the spreadsheet and perform mathematical calculations, such as finding the sum of values in a row or searching out the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values in a dataset.
- Spreadsheets lack the constraints of a relational database and offer total flexibility in how they organize data.
- The power of spreadsheets comes from their low barrier to entry and their ability to be easily shared with others.
- Microsoft Excel is the most commonly used desktop spreadsheet application, available as a component of the widely deployed Microsoft Office productivity suite.

_Programming Language:_
- Business analysts and data scientists often require software to load, manipulate, and analyze data independently.
- Skilled analysts find it easier to write their own code for analytics tasks than working within another package, as programming languages allow for direct action specification.

_R:_
- R, a popular programming language for data analysts, emerged in the 1990s as a niche statistical tool.
- It has since become a widely used tool for statisticians, data scientists, and business analysts worldwide.
- R's popularity is attributed to its accessibility as a free, open-source language, breaking the mold of proprietary software.
- It is also adopted by machine learning developers, with new techniques readily available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network.
- The tidyverse package simplifies data analysis, making R accessible to anyone.

_Python:_
- Python is a popular programming language, similar to R but with a general-purpose nature.
- It can code video games and perform complex data analysis. However, Python requires more expertise and coding concepts like looping and branching.
- Developers typically have a formal computer science background.
- Python also has specialized libraries, like pandas, for data analysis and structuring.

_Structured Query Lamguage(SQL):_
- SQL is the language used by developers, administrators, and end users to interact with databases.
- It is divided into two major sublanguages: Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).
- DDL commands define the structure of a database, while DML commands work with the data inside the database.
- To prepare for an exam, it is essential to be familiar with the major commands used in SQL. Three DDL commands are CREATE, ALTER, and DROP. DML commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
- Accessing databases can be done through various methods.
- Developers can directly access the database server through a graphical user interface, such as Azure Data Studio, which allows them to write SQL queries, send them to the database, and view the results.
- Azure Data Studio also offers a graphical way for administrators to reconfigure a database.
- Query and report builder tools simplify database access for end users, allowing them to retrieve data from a database.
- Computer software can interact with databases programmatically, sending SQL commands to the database as part of its activity.

# Statistics Packages:
- Statistics packages offer advanced statistical environments accessible through a graphical user interface or built-in scripting language.
- These packages are mainly used by professional statisticians, with computer science-based data analysts preferring programming languages for code writing, while those without a strong background in statistics prefer visually oriented tools.

_IBM SPSS:_
- IBM's SPSS, an ancient statistical software package, is a popular and widely used tool among statisticians, having been released in 1968.

_Stata:_
- Stata, a 1980s statistical analysis package, offers similar features to SAS and SPSS, with a graphical and command-line interface, though less widely used than these tools.

_Minitab:_
- The Data+ exam covers Minitab, an older statistical software package with similar features to SPSS, SAS, and Stata.

# Machine Learning
- The industry uses graphical tools to assist analysts in building machine learning models without writing code, making techniques more accessible and allowing for model parameter tuning without scripting.

_IBM SPSS Modeler:_
- IBM's SPSS Modeler is a popular tool for creating graphical machine learning models, offering an intuitive interface for users to design tasks, connect them, and visually explore results.

_RapidMiner:_
- RapidMiner is a graphical machine learning tool, similar to IBM SPSS Modeler, with access to various algorithms in a visually designed workflow.
- It also provides prebuilt analytic templates for business scenarios.

# Analytics Suites
- Most organizations now prefer using comprehensive analytics suites that cover all stages of the analytics process.
- These tools enable analysts to handle data ingestion and cleaning, statistical analysis, data visualization, model building, prediction making, and reporting.
- While these packages are costlier, they offer an integrated environment for collaboration between analysts and developers.

_IBM Cognos:_
- IBM Cognos is an integrated analytics suite that provides analysts in organizations with access to data through a web-based platform.
- It utilizes IBM's Watson artificial intelligence capability and includes components like Cognos Connection for portal access, Query Studio for data querying, Report Studio for advanced report design, Analysis Studio for modeling and analytics, Event Studio for real-time data monitoring, Metric Studio for creating scorecards, and Cognos Viewer for stakeholders to interact with data and analyses.
- This suite is designed to help business leaders make informed decisions by providing insights from data analysis.

_Microsoft Power BI:_
- Power BI is Microsoft's analytics suite built on the popular SQL Server database platform, favored by organizations for easy integration with other Microsoft software.
- Components include Power BI Desktop for data analysts, the Power BI service for cloud access, mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows, Power BI Report Builder for paginated reports, and Power BI Report Server for internal hosting.
- This suite enables users to interact with data, create reports, and share insights within their organization.
- Power BI's popularity lies in its cost-effective bundling with Microsoft enterprise licenses and its seamless integration with other Microsoft products.

_MicroStrategy:_
- MicroStrategy is a lesser-known analytics suite compared to IBM and Microsoft.
- Despite this, it has a strong user base and offers similar tools for building dashboards, reports, and utilizing machine learning on business data.

_Domo:_
- Domo is a SaaS analytics platform for businesses to analyze and model their data.
- While not widely used, it is included in the objectives for the Data exam.

_Datorama:_
- Salesforce Datorama utilizes machine learning and visualization to analyze sales and marketing data.
- It is a specialized analytics tool tailored for optimizing sales and marketing strategies within an organization.

_AWS QuickSight:_
- AWS QuickSight is a dashboarding tool included in Amazon Web Services.
- It is unique because of its pay-as-you-go model and integration with data storage, warehousing, machine learning, and AI capabilities within the Amazon cloud.

_Tableau:_
- Tableau is a widely used data visualization tool known for its easy data integration from various sources and strong visualization features.
- It helps users quickly identify trends and analyze specific details within their data.

_Qlik:_
- Qlik is a widely used SaaS analytics platform that offers cloud-based analytics tools.
